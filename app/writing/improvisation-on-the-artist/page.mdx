<TOC title="Improvisation on the Artist" />

> My environment is unnatural, unsensual, tough and uncompromising. Within this milieu I have decided to create my art. The painting is not the conduit. I am the conduit. 

As the hour ticked onwards, my family grew more and more tired of me. Apart from a painting of an evil baby that my mom really seemed to enjoy, it was clear they'd had their fair share of being dragged along through the Museum of Modern Art.

So, I made promises to be hasty with my exploration of the sixth floor, where a new exhibition had recently been launched: [Jack Whitten: The Messenger](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5785).

I walk up the stairs, hearing the faint whisper of *So What* by Miles Davis playing at the top. Reaching the landing, I take my immediate surroundings in, and catch a glimpse of the cosmic window adorning the left wall.

It reads: *Homecoming: For Miles Davis*

As my steps fall closer and closer, the painting's outer constellations begin to exceed the boundaries of my vision. My burgeoning heartbeat burns up as I reach into the expanse of stars, ultimately silenced in the face of infinity portrayed behind each individual tile. Soon, the rest of me follows.

American Artist Jack Whitten (1939-2018) created this piece in commemoration of his friend and jazz musician, Miles Davis, who passed the year earlier. The visual art form he used was one that he created himself, known as the *Acrylic Tesserae*.

The process to create the painting started with Whitten laying down sheets of acrylic, and splattering droplets of white paint over them. After they had dried, he would carve each individual tile and rearrange them to form a "cosmic net." [^1]

As I explored the rest of his exhibit, it became clear that Whitten had a deep connection to jazz, not just in his relationships, but in all aspects of his life and his art.

I believe that avenues exist between conceptual awe & understanding of a subject, collapsed in both directions by our experiences with it. It is up to us to color the entrances with curiosity and the ends with comprehension.

*And so, I let my curiosity carry me forward.*

## Double Shift Originality

For all of his life, Jack Whitten had felt a connection to jazz music.

He started as a sax player in junior high, years before he ever started painting. But after moving to New York, he knew his musicianship was not up-to-par in order to participate in the experimental jazz scene.

> The music was a way of me defining myself. I couldn't do it with the horn, so I figured I could deal with it in paint. [^2]

It became clear to me as I explored how Whitten talked about music, that he saw jazz as a conduit which bound both forms of artistry—both visual and audible. To him, his paintings were another way to create "the music," they were an abstraction on how he wanted art to define him.

## Philosophy of Jazz

To Jack Whitten, jazz represented an "expansion of freedom" [^3] due to its embrace of improvisation; its spontaneous nature imposes no limits on feeling or expression.

Whitten saw improvisation as a necessary element of art. Without it, the "spirit" of art and jazz alike would, in essence, be stale and unmoving. But he also believed that spontaneity alone would not allow for art to connect with us. It needed help in the form of the "conceptual":

> The acceptance of spontaneity/improvisation does not **reject** the value of conceptual thought. Conceptualism is a tool in the service of spontaneity/improvisation. The multidimensional sheets of sound in John Coltrane's music could not reach cognition without the conceptual. [^4]

Whitten parallels "conceptualism" to composition: the structural elements that underlay all forms of art and music. There would be nothing to improvise over or incite spontaneity if not for that compositional skeleton. Hence, art can not be truly felt without both elements.

Imagine, for example, what a musician needs when improvising: the key, the time, the motifs & melodies all act as pieces of structure, the building blocks of the song for the musician to push and pull away from within their improvisation. Without these, they would have nothing to contradict and nothing to magnify.

Whitten wished for own his work to represent these ideas, desiring his "color to be improvisational." [^5]

Knowing this, it's not surprising that Whitten's philosophy on jazz can be witnessed in every aspect of his craft. His paintings were not separated from the ways in which he thought about improvisation and conceptualism. They were, if nothing else, an embodiment of those principles. 

To him, he *was* creating jazz.

Enter *Russian Speedway,* an oil painting that Whitten created in 1971.

/>

He started by laying down the compositional foundation of the piece, pooling layer after layer of paint on top of one another. Then, using a T-Shaped tool he fashioned called the 'Developer,' he swiftly spread the topmost layer of paint in a *single improvised gesture* carried across the canvas.

/>

Whitten transposed this technique onto other paintings like *Chinese Sincerity* (1974). The process of layering paint would always remain the same between these instances, but the moment in which it was ruptured was always executed improvisationally.

According to Whitten, it's in these moments that he has been programmed to act—to "purely conceptualize it"—like how a jazz musician can play without thinking after years of technical training. [^6] 

It's in these moments that his paintings are made. [^7]

## Homecoming

I view Jack Whitten's expression of Miles Davis through the lens of how [Yousuf Karsh photographed Cellist Pablo Casals](https://karsh.org/photographs/pablo-casals/)—capturing not physical likeness, but artistic essence.

> The point I want to make with painting is that abstraction, as we know it, can be
> directed towards the specifics of subject—a person, a thing, an experience. [^8]

Whitten states in his studio journal that his paint is the "synthesis of concreteness plus abstraction," [^9] the composition plus improvisation. If we view abstraction as the spontaneous element, we can see that Whitten directs his improvisations towards the specifics of his subjects.

In *Homecoming*, the subject *is* Miles Davis, and the specifics are the essence and soul he put into his jazz. These specifics play the same role that the **key** does in a musical composition.

Whitten's improvisation breaks us out of Davis's figurative key by portraying his soul through a **visual medium**, pushing away from and abstracting on top of its traditionally **auditory nature**. It is the structural element necessary for spontaneity to be achieved. But like all good jazz, there is a push and pull away from form.
 
Given that Davis's ability to improvise was something so central to his style and identity as a jazz musician, he and Whitten become bound through that shared form of artistic expression. Again, we are seeing the visual and audible bridged together with jazz as their conduit. 
This expression, previously informing the *contradiction of structure* within the portrayal of Davis's musicianship, becomes the very thing that pulls it *back into* key.

Despite the differences in the mode and medium in which Whitten and Davis navigate jazz, their improvisations serve as the breathtaking foundation behind *Homecoming*.

> Experimentation is the key. I believe that there are sounds we have not heard. I believe that there are colors we have not seen. And I believe that there are feelings yet to be felt. [^10]
