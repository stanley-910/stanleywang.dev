<TOC title="Improvisation on the Artist" />

> My environment is unnatural, unsensual, tough and uncompromising. Within this milieu I have decided to create my art. The painting is not the conduit. I am the conduit. 

As the hour ticked onwards, my family grew more and more tired of me. Apart from a painting of an evil baby that my mom really seemed to enjoy, it was clear they'd had their fair share of being dragged along through the Museum of Modern Art.

So, I made promises to be hasty with my exploration of the sixth floor, where a new exhibition had recently been launched: [Jack Whitten: The Messenger](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5785).

I walk up the stairs, hearing the faint whisper of *So What* by Miles Davis playing at the top. Reaching the landing, I take my immediate surroundings in, and catch a glimpse of the cosmic window adorning the left wall.

It reads: *Homecoming: For Miles Davis*

As my steps fall closer and closer, the painting's outer constellations begin to exceed the boundaries of my vision. My burgeoning heartbeat burns up as I reach into the expanse of stars, ultimately silenced in the face of infinity portrayed behind each individual tile. Soon, the rest of me follows.

American Artist Jack Whitten (1939-2018) created this piece in commemoration of his friend and Jazz Musician, Miles Davis, who passed the year earlier. The visual art form he used was one that he created himself, known as the *Acrylic Tesserae*.

The process to create the painting started with laying down sheets of acrylic, and splattering droplets of white paint over them. After they had dried, He would carve each individual tile and rearrange them to form a "cosmic net." [^1]

As I explored the rest of his exhibit, it became clear that Whitten had a deep connection to jazz, not just in his relationships, but in all aspects of his life and his art.

I couldn't help but wonder how this connection inspired and instilled meaning into his art.

I believe that avenues exist between conceptual awe & understanding of a subject, collapsed in both directions by your experiences with it. It is up to us to color the entrances with curiosity and the ends with comprehension.

*And so, I let my curiosity carry me forward.*

## Double Shift Originality

For all of his life, Jack Whitten had felt a connection to jazz music.

He started as a sax player in junior high, years before he ever started painting. But after moving to New York, he knew his musicianship was not up-to-par in order to participate in the experimental jazz scene at that time.

> The music was a way of me defining myself. I couldn't do it with the horn, so I figured I could deal with it in paint. [^2]

It became clear to me as I explored how Whitten talked about music, that he saw "jazz" as a conduit which bound both forms of artistry—both visual and audible. To him, his paintings were another way to create "the music", they were an abstraction on how he wanted art to define him.

## Philosophy of Jazz

To Jack Whitten, jazz represented an "expansion of freedom" [^3] due to its embrace of improvisation—a spontaneous expression which imposed no limits on feeling or expression.

Whitten saw improvisation as a necessary element of art. Without it, the "spirit" of art and jazz alike would, in essence, be stale and unmoving. But he also believed that spontaneity alone would not allow for art to connect with us. It needed help in the form of the "conceptual":

> The acceptance of spontaneity/improvisation does not **reject** the value of conceptual thought. Conceptualism is a tool in the service of spontaneity/improvisation. The multidimensional sheets of sound in John Coltrane's music could not reach cognition without the conceptual. [^4]

Whitten parallels "conceptualism" to composition: the structural elements that underlay all forms of art and music. There would be nothing to improvise over or incite spontaneity if not for that compositional skeleton, hence, art can not be truly felt without both elements.

Imagine, for example, what a musician needs when improvising: the key, the time, the motifs & melodies all act as pieces of structure, the building blocks of the song for the musician to push and pull away from within their improvisation. Without these, they would have nothing to contradict and nothing to magnify.

Whitten wished for his work to represent these ideas, stating that he wanted his "color to be improvisational." [^5]

Knowing this, it's not surprising that Whitten's philosophy on jazz can be witnessed in every aspect of his craft. His paintings were not separated from the ways in which he thought about improvisation and the conceptual. They were, if nothing else, an embodiment of those principles. To him, he *was* creating jazz.

Enter *Russian Speedway,* an oil painting that Whitten created in 1971.

/>

To create it, he first lays down the compositional foundation of the piece by pooling layer after layer of paint on top of another, creating a "Slab" of paint. Then, using a T-Shaped tool he fashioned called the 'Developer', he would swiftly spread the topmost layer of paint in a single improvised gesture carried across the canvas.

/>

This technique carried into other paintings like *Chinese Sincerity* (1974). The process of layering paint remained the same between instances, but the moment in which it was ruptured always carried spontaneity.

According to Whitten, it is in those moments where he has been programmed act, to "purely conceptualize it," like how a jazz musician, after years of technical practice, can play without thinking. [^6] It is in those moments where his paintings are made. [^7]

## Homecoming

I view Jack Whitten's expression of Miles Davis through the lens of how [Yousuf Karsh photograped Cellist Pablo Casals](https://karsh.org/photographs/pablo-casals/)—capturing not the man himself, but his essence and dedication to his art.

> The point I want to make with painting is that abstraction, as we know it, can be
> directed towards the specifics of subject—a person, a thing, an experience. [^8]

Whitten states in his studio journal that his paint is the "synthesis of concreteness plus abstraction," the composition plus improvisation. If we view abstraction as the spontaneous element, we can see that Whitten directs his improvisations towards the specifics of his subjects.

In *Homecoming*, the subject *is* Miles Davis, the specifics of which being the essence and soul Davis put into his music.

If the key of Davis's soul is his music, Whitten brings us out of key by portraying the soul visually. It acts as the structural element his improvisation is breaking away from. But like any good improvisation, there is a push and pull away from form.

Through the very fact that Davis's ability to improvise was something so central to his style and identity as a jazz musician, Whitten's visual portrayal of this musicianship is pulled back into key. While the mode and medium of improvisation between Davis & Whitten are at times different, that connective tissue between the two serves as a breathtaking foundation for *Homecoming*.

> Experimentation is the key. I believe that there are sounds we have not heard. I believe that there are colors we have not seen. And I believe that there are feelings yet to be felt. [^9]
