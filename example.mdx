# Using Spotify Embeds in MDX

You can embed Spotify tracks, albums, or playlists in your blog posts using the Spotify component. Here are some examples:

## Track Example
<Spotify link="https://open.spotify.com/track/5ihDGnhQgMA0F0tk9fNLlA" />

## Album Example (Wide Mode)
<Spotify link="https://open.spotify.com/album/4eLPsYPBmXABThSJ821sqY" wide={true} />

## Playlist Example
<Spotify link="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M" />

You can customize the width and add additional styling using the `className` prop:

<Spotify 
  link="https://open.spotify.com/track/5ihDGnhQgMA0F0tk9fNLlA" 
  className="my-12"
/>
